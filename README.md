# GameMaker Assignment #1

Malorie Pugh

This is my submission for Assignment #1.

I had issues with:
* The difference between Draw and Create when it comes to making sprites work in a room (rm_).
* Fixing errors, debugging, but of course that will take time and patience.

Additional Comments:

Hopefully, next time I will be able to think through errors easier.
